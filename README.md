#Bloxed#

Bloxed is a simple "push the blocks and collect the keys" game that runs in your browser.

Only html5 web standards are used, so no need for flash or any such nonsense. It does require a fairly modern browser though. I've tested it with Chrome and Firefox.

I wrote bloxed as a learning exercise for JavaScript and the excellent [Pixi.js](http://www.pixijs.com/) 2D WebGL library.

My code might not be pretty, but feel free to use whatever you like from it.

You don't need to clone the repo locally if you just want to try the game. Just point your browser at: [http://www.kevssite.com/bloxed](http://www.kevssite.com/bloxed)
